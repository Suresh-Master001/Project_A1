# TODO: Decorate Webpage with Hover Effects and Smooth Animations Using Tailwind CSS (Blue Gradient Theme)

## Current Work
Enhancing the entire webpage with consistent hover effects (scale, shadow, blue gradient color shifts) and smooth animations (fade-in, slide-up) across all components. Focus on blue gradients for interactive elements to maintain professional cohesion.

## Key Technical Concepts
- Tailwind CSS utilities: transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out, hover:scale-105, hover:shadow-xl, bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-blue-600.
- Animations: Built-in animate-fade-in, custom slide-up via opacity/translate-y with delays for stagger effects.
- Responsiveness: Ensure effects work on mobile/desktop without performance issues.
- No new dependencies; extend existing Tailwind setup.

## Relevant Files and Code
- src/components/Header.js: Nav links - add hover blue gradient bg and scale.
- src/components/Hero.js: Text elements - slide-up animation; buttons - blue gradient hovers (already partially done).
- src/components/ServicesPreview.js: Cards - hover:scale-105 with blue gradient overlay; stagger fade-in.
- src/components/AboutPreview.js: Stats cards - hover pulse with blue shadow; section fade-in.
- src/components/CTA.js: Button - blue gradient shift on hover, bounce animation.
- src/components/Services.js: Service cards - similar to ServicesPreview, slide-up on load.
- src/components/About.js: Team cards - hover lift with blue gradients.
- src/components/Contact.js: Form inputs/buttons - focus ring blue gradient, smooth transitions.
- src/components/Footer.js: Links - hover underline with blue color shift.
- src/App.js: Add global animation classes to sections if needed.
- tailwind.config.js: Extend theme for custom blue gradient animations if required.

## Problem Solving
- Ensure animations are smooth (use ease-in-out); avoid over-animating to prevent lag.
- Blue gradients: Use from-blue-400/500 to-blue-600/700 for hovers to match theme.
- Stagger effects: Use CSS delays in classes (e.g., delay-100, delay-200) for card animations.

## Pending Tasks and Next Steps
- [x] Update src/components/Header.js: Add hover effects to nav links with blue gradient backgrounds and fade-in animation. "User approved plan with blue gradients; starting with Header as it's the top navigation."
- [x] Update src/components/Hero.js: Implement slide-up animations for title and paragraph; enhance buttons with blue gradient hovers.
- [x] Update src/components/ServicesPreview.js: Add hover scale and blue gradient to cards; stagger fade-in for the grid.
- [x] Update src/components/AboutPreview.js: Enhance stats cards with hover pulse and blue shadows; add section fade-in.
- [x] Update src/components/CTA.js: Add blue gradient hover shift and subtle bounce to button.
- [x] Update src/components/Services.js: Apply consistent card hovers and slide-up animations.
- [x] Update src/components/About.js: Add hover effects to team cards with blue gradients.
- [x] Update src/components/Contact.js: Enhance form elements with blue focus rings and smooth transitions.
- [x] Update src/components/Footer.js: Add hover color shifts to links using blue theme.
- [x] Update src/App.js: Ensure global sections have smooth entry animations.
- [x] Optional: Update tailwind.config.js if custom keyframes needed for advanced animations.
- [x] Test: Use browser_action to verify all effects on home and other pages; check responsiveness.
- [x] Mark all as complete and attempt_completion.
- [x] All components updated with blue gradient hover effects and smooth animations. Removed complex animations to focus on professional, subtle effects.
